export { ErrorMapper } from "./ErrorMapper";

/*
  This file `index.ts` defines the `utils` module (since it's in the `utils` folder)

  You can add additional functionality to the `utils` by "re-exporting" other modules in the folder (see ErrorMapper above.)

  This allows you to flexibly import utilities in other modules

  import { ErrorMapper } from "utils";
  or
  import { ErrorMapper } from "utils/ErrorMapper"
